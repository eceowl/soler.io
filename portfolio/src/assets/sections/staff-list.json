I've been a digital content writer and strategist since 2012. Every social media account I made, every blog I started, every chance I could I would craft a colorful version of myself and the brands I worked for. I break rules, I have fun, I end sentences with prepositions and don't give a sh*t. I'll make your brand look baller and leave my sailor mouth at sea... unless you're into that sort of thing.",
